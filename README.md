Welcome! If you are here, you have BrotherMunro's Dreadnoughts Improvement Mod and are here for one of the below reasons:

1. You are a monarchist at heart and want to see Empress Isabel the Redeemer or Kaiser Wilhelm II still lording over their fleets in the 1920s
2. You take odd satisfaction at seeing your entire screen filled with bright eye-searing green from long highbrow ship names
3. You want more ship names for (insert nation name with insufficient number of ship names here)
4. You just really think the monarchy flags just look better

This is the place! This submod replaces a few files from the DIP mod, adding in new ship name pools for various nations, changing the campaign start conditions for various nations to monarchies, and making a few
fixes to the files to ensure that the correct flags are displayed at a given time (it's quite clear the mod was never playtested with a Brazilian monarchy, for example, a condition which in the normal gameplay
will literally never happen). Even if you're not a monarchist at heart, you can still enjoy the variety of new ship name pools!

There are a few "editions" of this submod.

MAIN: For DIP with Korea.

NO KOREA: For DIP without Korea. All playable western nations that historically had a functional monarchy at one point are now monarchies for all start dates (Brazil, UK, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Russia, 
  Italy, Austria, Ottomans, Greece). Note that France is based on an Orleanist restoration. China will still become the ROC after 1910 start date for reasons I'll explain.

EXTREME MONARCHY: For DIP with Korea. All playable western nations besides the United States are now monarchies for all start dates. The United States remains the lone beacon of democracy in the world. Note that
  France is based on an Orleanist restoration, Argentina is based on a proposed Kingdom of La Plata using Queen Carlota of Portugal and then a Miguelist branch of Braganza, and Chile is based on a completely
  made up alt history from the Habsburgs. China will still become the ROC after 1910 start date for reasons I'll explain. WIP

LESS MONARCHY: For DIP with Korea. Only monarchies that existed in the earliest start date (1890) are monarchies for all start dates; nations that start as democracies in 1890 will remain democracies as in
  vanilla. This means a democratic France and Brazil, along with adjusted ship name pools to match. This is a much more "historical" experience, although you'll still get the Russian and German empires in 1940.
  Until I figure out a way to have name pools that change over by government type, I think this is the best balance to make the name pools "correct" to history.


Why no China changes? Unfortunately, I am very unfamiliar with Chinese or other Asian languages and as such I will only make minor adjustments to their ship names, and keep them on the default historical path.

Why no British names? I tried to make some new names, but I think the Royal Navy's battleships are sufficiently famous that any serious changes to the entire naming pool just doesn't sound correct. Given that
  the Royal Navy's ship naming customs basically date back centuries, it wouldn't make sense for the United Kingdom to have such a sudden urge to change their name pools.

Why no Korean/Japanese names? Again, I am unfamiliar with these languages and lack any real way of anglicizing the language, so they will be left as-is.



All versions of this submod will be saved and backed up here; however this submod was created when 3a9 was the current version and I will not be making versions for any DIP version older than this.
You may freely use this in your own work. I appreciate credit but it is not necessary (let's be real, doing this wasn't hard codewise, the real work was tons of Google).

To use, simply download all of these files, then replace the mod's original files with matching names with these. Replacing English.lng is not required for this mod, but does contain slightly revised campaign text. You may choose to only replace shipNames if you wish to keep the full governments as in vanilla and use only the updated ship name pools.
